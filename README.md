R-Package Triangle Method


The R-Package
This R-package provides users an easy and comprehensive way to derive evapotranspiration patterns from remote sensing imagery and little ancillary data. While the default parameterization of the method is based on Landsat ETM and ETM+ imagery, the package provides flexibility to adjust the parameters to other data sources. In this regard, the package was successfully applied to drone data, among others.
