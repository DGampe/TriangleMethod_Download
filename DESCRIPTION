Description: The Triangle Method (Jiang & Islam, 1999) approach provides
    estimations for actual evapotranspiration using remotely sensed information
    as the Normalized Differnce Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface
    Temperature (LST). This package provides functions to derive those
    information from common LANDSAT TM and ETM+ scenes (might be modified by
    the user to work also for other sensors). The function 'triangle' then
    reads in these two grid-files (NDVI & LST) and allows to estimate actual
    evpotranspiration. Furthermore, the functions grid.plot provides a way to
    plot gridded data (as the final ETact, or NDVI etc.), based on the
    spplot-function and the package sp.
